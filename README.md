Skuë is a [Go](http://golang.org/) package intended to facilitate the creation of pragmatic [REST](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) APIs for Go servers.

## What "skuë" means?

Skuë means **"mouse"** in [Bribrí](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bribri_language) which is the language of an indigenous group of people of [Costa Rica](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNTirQ9eoLo), my Country.

## What is it?

Skuë is just some helper interfaces and functions working together to link separate software pieces in order to create an API REST-like server.

It does not force you to use a particular web server implementation or even a particular routing solution.  And it allows you to control the different moving parts of your API separately so you can replace them in the future if you want to.
